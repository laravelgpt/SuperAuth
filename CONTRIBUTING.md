```

### Testing

All new features must include tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
composer test

# Run specific test suite
vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Feature/YourTest.php

# Run with coverage
vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-html coverage
```

    public function test_feature_works_correctly()
    {
        // Arrange
        $user = User::factory()->create();
        
        // Act
        $result = $this->performAction($user);
        
        // Assert
        $this->assertTrue($result);
    }
}
```
